  Description:
  I have created this plug so that the customers can give reviews to the products and rating to the products. The reviews and ratings can be
  controlled from the plugin settings and we have a freedom to choose which ever review we want to postvand we can post them. There is a 
  freedom to customise review fields, rating stars, colours etc. 
  
  After installing this plugin and activating it it shows a reviews options and settings in the dashbord. We can add this plugin to the posts, blogs, pages
  and products. The option to on this will be at the bottom of the pages, posts, blogs, and products. After switching it to on it directly reflects on the 
  main web page. 

  In the Review options we can select the comments and rating and can publish which ever we want and we have an option to delete the comments and reviews.
